            <p>It's crazy to think about how the Coronavirus blew up. Apparently the source of COVID-19 came from a market in Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and birds. These markets seemed to provide a heightened risk of viruses jumping from animals to humans.</p>

            <p>There are more than 250,000 cases for COVID-19 and over 10,000 deaths. Although the death rate is low, it's important to realize the severity of the virus for elderly people and young children. People with weaker systems are more susceptible to the virus so it's in the world's best interest to try and contain the pandemic.</p>

            <p>Social distancing has been the world's best bet for containing the virus but, how long until we find a cure?</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence is finding ways to fight back. A startup called FluSense is capturing cough sounds through a collection of microphones and people via a thermal camera that detects body heat.
            </p>

            <p>The data they collect is processed through a Raspberry PI, which is linked to neural network that recognizes the sound of coughs. The system then counts the number of coughs and people to predict where the coronavirus is spreading.</p>

            <p>The system accurately identified coughs 81% of the time. Needs work, but any effort to combat COVID-19 is a good one.</p>
