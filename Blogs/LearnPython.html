            <p>My Python journey is a little weird. My whole programming journey is a little weird. I started learning HTML, CSS and JS, and I couldn't figure out JavaScript for the longest time. It was a foreign language, I bought the YDKJS series and it kind of helped. But Python helped me excel in learning basic programming skills.</p>

            <p>I started to explore Node.js when I made a portfolio website that uses a SendGrid API key to send emails to your inbox. There's a new library for JavaScript everyday and using one language has been nice to say the least.</p>

            <p>After scrolling on Reddit, I saw that the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" course by Al Sweigart, was free for a couple days, so I thought might as well give it a shot. 
            </p>

            <p>I made a Sudoku Solver which was so rewarding seeing it actually work. I ran the GUI and it actually worked. Working with Python has put me in a realm of endless possibilities.</p>

            <p><strong>So, should you learn Python?</strong></p>

            <p>Why not? Just start. I feel like a lot of people get caught up in what language is hot and what's not. <strong>GO CODE.</strong> There's a new framework everyday, if you get familiar with one, trust yourself to be able to make the switch.</p>

            <p>I am currently building an Instagram Bot with Python and will post on my projects page when I'm done. Keep hacking!</p>
