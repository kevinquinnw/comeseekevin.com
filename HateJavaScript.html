        <h2>Why do people hate JS?</h2>
        <h5>Seriously, what makes it so bad? - 2020/02/22</h5>

            <p>When I've talked to friends or am browsing on Reddit, I see a lot of memes and general hate towards JavaScript. </p>

            <p>Why?</p>

            <p>There 's a new framework every other day and I don't think that's an exaggeration. I personally don't mind working with a framework because it's made to make developer's lives easier. I think it's just hard to keep up.</p>

            <p>Here is what I think sucks about JavaScript:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>ES6 <strong>class</strong> is basically meaningless as it has no inherent scope privacy for its methods and properties, making encapsulation impossible using standard <strong>class</strong> syntax. </li><br>

                <li>Changing words and grammar. The interpreters and environments are ever-evolving. For some, this was overwhelming. When I started to learn how to code I was confused by how much was out there and how new things got introduced everyday.</li><br>

                <li>It's kind of bonkers. Callbacks, as a pattern, are used extensively to deal with the single threaded model. Thus leading to a lot of heavily nested callbacks. </li><br>

            </ol>

            <p>Overall, I actually really like JavaScript, I think it has a lot to offer. Since it's used everywhere, it's not going away anytime soon. Everything uses JavaScript for the most part so if you're struggling with it, consider reading YDKJS and just give yourself more exposure to writing code in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Maybe even try TypeScript.</p>
